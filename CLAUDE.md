# TaskMaster Project Standards & Guidelines

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

**These principles define HOW we work on this project:**

### 1. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (BATCH TDD APPROACH)

**All code must be developed using BATCH TDD with specifications from prd.txt**

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Modified TDD Approach

This project uses a **Batch TDD approach** that differs from traditional TDD:

**❌ Traditional TDD (NOT used here):**

- Write ONE test → Make it pass → Refactor → Repeat for next test

**✅ Our Batch TDD (MANDATORY approach):**

1. **RED Phase (Batch)**: Write ALL tests for the entire functionality at once
   - Contract tests from PRD specifications
   - Edge cases and error scenarios
   - Integration tests
   - ALL tests should be RED initially

2. **GREEN Phase (Implementation)**: Implement code to pass ALL tests
   - See the complete contract upfront
   - Optimize implementation knowing all requirements
   - Avoid duplication through shared utilities
   - Work until 100% tests are GREEN

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Clean up while keeping ALL tests GREEN

#### Benefits of Batch TDD

- Complete visibility of the entire contract before implementation
- Better architectural decisions with full context
- Opportunity to optimize and avoid code duplication
- Clearer understanding of edge cases and integration points

#### Requirements

- Test specifications location: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`
- Test cases must be copied exactly from prd.txt specifications
- Never create test cases based on assumptions
- Exception: Configuration and setup tasks may not require tests

#### 🔴 CRITICAL RULE: Task Completion Requirements

**A task or subtask can ONLY be marked as complete when:**

- ✅ ALL tests are GREEN (passing)
- ✅ NO tests are RED (failing)
- ✅ NO tests are SKIPPED (unless explicitly approved by user)

**NEVER complete a task with failing tests!**

### 2. REAL DATABASE TESTING

**Database interactions must be tested with real databases**

- Use Testcontainers with PostgreSQL for all database tests
- Never mock database operations, migrations, or queries
- Integration tests must use actual database connections

### 3. CURRENT DOCUMENTATION

**Always use up-to-date documentation via Context7 MCP**

- Get current docs BEFORE using any external library
- Never rely on potentially outdated knowledge
- Applies to all external dependencies

### 4. BUILD QUALITY GATES

**All code must pass quality checks before commit**

- **Standard validation**: `yarn validate` (build + typecheck + lint + test)
  - Excludes performance tests tagged with `[perf]` for faster feedback
  - Use during development for quick validation
  - **⚠️ Only for non-critical changes** (UI fixes, documentation, simple logic)

- **Comprehensive validation**: `yarn validate:all` (build + typecheck + lint + test:all)
  - Includes ALL tests (regular + performance + integration)
  - **🔴 MANDATORY for these changes:**
    - Database schema, migrations, or queries
    - Repository implementations or data access layer
    - Performance-critical code or optimizations
    - Integration between multiple services
    - Caching, background jobs, or async operations
    - API contracts with database interactions
    - Any code touching Testcontainer-tested functionality
  - Use before final commits or in CI/CD

- No commit should be made if any check fails
- Fix all errors before proceeding

**🔴 CRITICAL RULE: When in doubt, use `yarn validate:all`**

If your changes involve:

- ❌ Database (PostgreSQL, Redis, migrations)
- ❌ Performance (queries, indexes, optimizations)
- ❌ Integration (API + DB, caching, async jobs)
- ❌ Repository layer or data access
- ❌ Batch operations or large datasets

→ **You MUST run `yarn validate:all`** to ensure integration tests pass!

**Test Script Variants:**

```bash
yarn test        # Regular tests only (excludes [perf] tagged tests)
yarn test:perf   # Performance tests only ([perf] tagged tests)
yarn test:all    # All tests (regular + performance)
```

See [.claude/TEST-TAGGING-EXAMPLES.md](.claude/TEST-TAGGING-EXAMPLES.md) for details on performance test tagging.

**🔴 CRITICAL**: See [.claude/VALIDATION-RULES.md](.claude/VALIDATION-RULES.md) for **mandatory** validation rules.
**Future sessions: READ THIS DOCUMENT to understand when `validate:all` is REQUIRED!**

#### 🔴 CRITICAL: Test Validation Protocol

**MANDATORY test completion verification:**

1. **ALL tests MUST complete successfully** - no timeouts, no partial results
2. **Must see exact pattern**: `Tests: X passed, X total` (where both X are equal, zero failures)
3. **If tests timeout**: IMMEDIATELY increase timeout, never proceed on assumptions

**Timeout Handling Rules:**

```bash
# STEP 1: When tests timeout, increase Jest timeout
# Edit jest.config.js or package-specific config:
testTimeout: 300000  # 5 minutes for performance tests

# STEP 2: Or use per-test timeout
describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  jest.setTimeout(300000);
});

# STEP 3: Or command-line override
yarn test --testTimeout=300000
```

**NEVER:**

- ❌ Proceed with incomplete test validation
- ❌ Assume partial success = complete success
- ❌ Accept timeouts without increasing timeout
- ❌ Reduce test comprehensiveness to avoid timeouts

**ALWAYS:**

- ✅ Show final test count: "Tests: 80/80 passed (100%)"
- ✅ Increase timeout generously for performance/integration tests
- ✅ Verify 100% completion before any commit approval
- ✅ Performance tests with large datasets SHOULD take time

**Correct Validation Output:**

```
✅ Build: Success
✅ TypeScript: Success
✅ Lint: Success
✅ Tests: 142/142 passed (100% success rate)
```

**WRONG Validation Output:**

```
✅ Build: Success
✅ TypeScript: Success
✅ Lint: Success
❌ Missing test results!
```

### 5. INCREMENTAL DELIVERY

**Work must be completed incrementally with validation**

- One subtask at a time with approval between each
- Manual testing approval required before every commit
- Clear progress tracking and status updates

### 6. COMPREHENSIVE OVER QUICK

**When tests timeout, the solution is MORE TIME, not LESS TESTING:**

- ✅ Increase timeout to 5-10 minutes for performance tests
- ❌ Never reduce dataset size or test coverage to save time
- ✅ Performance validation REQUIRES adequate time
- ❌ Never sacrifice quality for speed
- ✅ Comprehensive testing > Quick execution

This principle is CRITICAL for maintaining code quality and catching performance issues early.

## 🧪 TESTING STANDARDS

### Test Classification

| Test Type   | Dependencies | When to Use             | Tools                 | Speed            | Coverage |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| Unit        | Mocked       | Isolated logic          | Jest + Mocks          | Fast (ms)        | Wide     |
| Integration | Real         | Database/API operations | Jest + Testcontainers | Medium (seconds) | Deep     |
| E2E         | Full stack   | User workflows          | Playwright/Cypress    | Slow (minutes)   | Complete |

### File Naming Convention

```bash
# Unit tests (isolated logic with mocks)
*.test.ts
*-unit.test.ts

# Integration tests (real dependencies)
*-integration.test.ts
*-contract.test.ts

# End-to-end tests
*.e2e.test.ts
*.spec.ts
```

### Integration Test Template

```typescript
import {
  PostgreSqlContainer,
  StartedPostgreSqlContainer,
} from '@testcontainers/postgresql';
import { DataSource } from 'typeorm';

describe('Feature Integration Tests', () => {
  let container: StartedPostgreSqlContainer;
  let dataSource: DataSource;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    container = await new PostgreSqlContainer('postgres:15').start();
    dataSource = new DataSource({
      type: 'postgres',
      host: container.getHost(),
      port: container.getMappedPort(5432),
      database: container.getDatabase(),
      username: container.getUsername(),
      password: container.getPassword(),
    });
    await dataSource.initialize();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await dataSource?.destroy();
    await container?.stop();
  });

  // Real integration tests here
});
```

### Testing Anti-Patterns

**❌ WRONG: Mock-based "Integration" Test**

```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - This is a unit test disguised as integration test
describe('Migration Integration Test', () => {
  const mockQueryRunner = {
    createTable: jest.fn(),
  };

  it('should run migration', async () => {
    await migration.up(mockQueryRunner as any); // ❌ FAKE INTEGRATION
  });
});
```

**✅ CORRECT: Real Integration Test**

```typescript
// DO THIS - Real database testing
describe('Migration Integration Test', () => {
  let container: StartedPostgreSqlContainer;
  let queryRunner: QueryRunner;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    container = await new PostgreSqlContainer('postgres:15').start();
    // ... real setup
  });

  it('should run migration on real database', async () => {
    await migration.up(queryRunner); // ✅ REAL INTEGRATION
    const table = await queryRunner.getTable('users');
    expect(table).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Test Quality Requirements

1. **Type Safety**: No `any` types in test code
2. **Cleanup**: Proper resource disposal (`afterAll`, `beforeEach`)
3. **Isolation**: Tests don't depend on each other
4. **Assertions**: Clear, specific expectations
5. **Performance**: Integration tests complete within reasonable time

### Test Timeout Best Practices

**Default Timeout Recommendations:**

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testTimeout: 120000, // 2 minutes default
  projects: [
    {
      displayName: 'unit',
      testTimeout: 60000, // 1 minute for unit tests
    },
    {
      displayName: 'integration',
      testTimeout: 180000, // 3 minutes for integration
    },
    {
      displayName: 'performance',
      testTimeout: 600000, // 10 minutes for performance tests
    },
  ],
};
```

**When Tests Timeout:**

1. INCREASE timeout first (don't reduce test coverage)
2. Use `--testTimeout=300000` flag for immediate override
3. Add per-test timeout for specific slow tests
4. NEVER compromise test quality for speed

## 🎨 E2E TESTING STANDARDS

### When Adding New UI Components

1. CREATE new E2E tests in `e2e/` following naming `XX-feature-name.spec.ts`
2. UPDATE page objects in `e2e/support/page-objects/`
3. TEST all user interactions and accessibility
4. VERIFY error scenarios and edge cases

### When Modifying Existing UI

1. UPDATE affected E2E tests to match new behavior
2. MODIFY page object methods if selectors change
3. VERIFY backward compatibility
4. TEST transition periods

### When Removing UI Features

1. REMOVE corresponding E2E tests
2. CLEAN UP page object methods
3. UPDATE dependent test suites

### E2E Coverage Requirements

- **Functionality**: Core features work as expected
- **User flows**: Complete journeys from start to finish
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure and recovery
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA
- **Cross-component integration**: Component interactions
- **Data integrity**: CRUD operations

### E2E Quality Standards

- Use semantic selectors (`data-testid`)
- Write descriptive test names (Given-When-Then)
- Include multilingual content support
- Test realistic scenarios
- Maintain test independence
- Clean up test data between tests

## 📚 CONTEXT7 MCP USAGE

Use Context7 to get current documentation for ANY external library:

```javascript
// Step 1: Resolve library ID
mcp__context7__resolve - library - id('library-name');

// Step 2: Get documentation with specific topic
mcp__context7__get -
  library -
  docs('/resolved/library-id', {
    topic: 'specific-feature', // e.g., "migrations", "testing"
    tokens: 8000, // increase for complex topics
  });
```

**Always get documentation BEFORE using any external library or framework.**

---

## 🏗️ BRANCHING STRATEGY

### Branch Hierarchy

- **Parent tasks** (have subtasks) → Create new branch
- **Leaf tasks** (no subtasks) → Work on parent's branch

### Branch Naming

- Format: `task/<id>-<description>`
- Use lowercase, hyphens for spaces
- Keep under 50 characters

### Merge Strategy

- **Top-level branches** → Merge into `main`
- **Intermediate branches** → Merge into parent branch
- **Leaf tasks** → Already on parent branch (no merge)

### Pull Request Rules

- **Top-level tasks** → PR to `main`
- **Intermediate tasks** → PR to parent branch
- **Leaf tasks** → No PR needed

---

## 🚀 WORKFLOW AUTOMATION

### Available Commands

**TaskMaster Commands (enforce all workflow rules automatically):**

- `/next-task` - Start work on next priority task
- `/complete-task` - Complete current task with validation (auto-creates PR when entire task done)
- `/fix-errors <package>` - Fix errors in specific package (for new sessions)

**Commands enforce:**

- Batch TDD approach (Write ALL tests → Implement until 100% GREEN → Refactor)
- 🔴 **ZERO tolerance for red tests** - cannot complete with ANY failing tests
- One subtask at a time workflow
- Mandatory build validation before commits
- Manual testing approval gates
- Proper git branching strategy
- Automated PR creation

### Command Location

Place command files in:

- `.claude/commands/` - Project-specific commands (shared with team)
- `~/.claude/commands/` - Personal commands (user-specific)

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Start**: `/next-task` → Opens prd.txt, starts Batch TDD cycle
2. **Work**:
   - Write ALL tests for current task first (Batch Red phase)
   - Implement until 100% tests are GREEN
   - Refactor while keeping all tests GREEN
3. **Complete**: `/complete-task` → Validates ALL tests are GREEN, then commits
4. **Repeat**: For each task (with approval between)
5. **Auto-PR**: `/complete-task` on final subtask → Auto-detects completion, creates PR automatically

### New Session Recovery (After Context Loss)

**When starting a NEW SESSION to continue work:**

1. **If fixing errors**: Use `/fix-errors <package>` command
   - Example: `/fix-errors backend` or `/fix-errors infrastructure/postgresql`
   - Focuses on single package to avoid overwhelming context
   - Re-establishes all Batch TDD rules
   - Ensures 100% tests pass in that package

2. **Key reminders for new sessions**:
   - ALL tests must be GREEN (no exceptions)
   - Increase timeouts, don't reduce test coverage
   - Show exact numbers: "Tests: X/X passed"
   - Fix one package completely before moving to another

## 🚫 COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS

### Testing Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Mocking database interactions instead of using Testcontainers
- ❌ Creating test cases without checking prd.txt
- ❌ Skipping integration tests for database operations
- ❌ Using `any` types in test code
- ❌ **Writing tests one by one** instead of all at once (violates Batch TDD)
- ❌ **Implementing partial functionality** with some tests still red
- ❌ **Marking tasks as done with ANY red tests**
- ❌ **Reducing test data to avoid timeouts** (increase timeout instead!)
- ❌ **Accepting partial test results** due to timeouts
- ❌ **Reporting "validation passed" without showing test numbers**
- ❌ **Assuming test success** when tests timeout or partially complete

### Development Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Using libraries without checking Context7 documentation

- ❌ Using traditional one-test-at-a-time TDD instead of Batch TDD
- ❌ Creating branches for leaf tasks
- ❌ **Starting new session without `/fix-errors`** when errors exist
- ❌ **Trying to fix multiple packages simultaneously** in new session
- ❌ **Forgetting Batch TDD rules** after context loss

### Quality Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Ignoring TypeScript errors
- ❌ Skipping cleanup in tests
- ❌ Tests that depend on execution order
- ❌ Integration tests taking longer than 30 seconds
