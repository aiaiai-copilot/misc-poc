# Complete Current Task

Finalize the current task and create pull request.

## 🔴 TASK COMPLETION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Completeness Validation

#### Branch and Task Verification

1. **Verify on correct branch**:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current  # Check current branch
   tm current                  # Get current task
   ```

   - If not on task branch, switch to it first
   - This ensures Task Master reads correct tasks.json state

2. **Validate task completion**:
   - Get current task using `tm current`
   - Verify ALL subtasks are complete using `tm list --parent=<task-id>`
   - Check for any pending or in-progress subtasks
   - If subtasks remain incomplete, stop and inform user

### Phase 2: Final Build Validation

Run comprehensive validation:

```bash
yarn build && yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn test
```

If E2E tests exist, also run:

```bash
yarn test-e2e
```

#### ⚠️ Docker Check for Test Failures

If integration or E2E tests fail (especially database-related):

1. **Check Docker status**: `docker ps`
2. **If Docker daemon is not running**, you'll see:
   - "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"
   - "Is the Docker daemon running?"
3. **Request user to start Docker**:

   ```bash
   sudo service docker start
   ```

4. **Wait for Docker to fully start** (5-10 seconds)
5. **Verify Docker is running**: `docker ps`
6. **Retry the failed tests**

Common Docker-related test failures:

- Database connection refused
- Redis/PostgreSQL/MongoDB timeouts
- "ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432" (or other ports)
- Container health check failures
- Test database setup errors

All checks must pass before proceeding.

### Phase 3: Task Status Update

Mark task as done BEFORE final commit:

```bash
tm set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done
```

### Phase 4: Final Approval Gate

## ⚠️ FINAL APPROVAL REQUIRED

**Task is ready for completion.**

### Pre-Completion Checklist

- ✅ All subtasks completed
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Build validation successful
- ✅ Code review ready
- ✅ Docker running (if using containers)

**Do you want to perform final manual testing before creating the PR?**

This is your last chance to:

1. Test the complete feature end-to-end
2. Verify all acceptance criteria met
3. Check for any regressions
4. Review code quality

**Type 'yes' or 'proceed' to approve, or describe any issues.**

> **WAITING FOR YOUR APPROVAL...**

### Phase 5: Final Commit

After approval, intelligently stage and commit:

1. **Review all changes** made during the task
2. **Analyze changed files** in context of the complete task
3. **Present summary** for approval, for example:

   ```
   Task #3.1 "Setup TypeORM" includes these changes:
   - Database configuration files
   - Entity definitions
   - Migration files
   - Integration tests
   - Updated dependencies

   Total: 15 files changed

   Review file list? (yes/no)
   ```

4. **Stage all task-related changes**
5. **Create comprehensive commit** with task completion message

### Phase 6: Push and Create PR

1. **Verify correct branch before push**:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current  # Ensure on task branch
   ```

2. **Push branch** to origin:

   ```bash
   git push origin <task-branch>
   ```

3. **Determine PR target**:
   - Top-level task branches → PR to `main`
   - Intermediate task branches → PR to parent branch
   - If on main/not a task branch → Skip PR creation

4. **Create Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title referencing task ID and description
   - Summary of what was accomplished
   - List of all completed subtasks
   - Testing status
   - Any relevant notes for reviewers

5. **Return to main branch (ONLY after task fully complete)**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure no more work on this task
   tm show <task-id>  # Verify status is 'done'

   # Only then return to main
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

   **⚠️ WARNING**: Only return to main after the ENTIRE task is complete.
   Premature return to main causes Task Master to lose task context!
