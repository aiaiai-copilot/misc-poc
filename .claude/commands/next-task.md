# Start Next Task

Begin work on the next task following TaskMaster workflow rules.

## üî¥ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES

### ONE SUBTASK AT A TIME

- Complete ONE subtask ‚Üí Get approval ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí ONLY THEN start next
- If task has subtasks, do them according to their interdependency (as a rule - sequentially)
- NEVER implement multiple subtasks without approval between each
- After each subtask: STOP and ask "Ready to continue with next subtask?"

### COMMIT APPROVAL REQUIRED

- NEVER commit without explicit user approval
- Always ask: "Ready for manual testing before commit?"
- Wait for user to say "yes", "proceed", or give clear approval
- User may request fixes - implement them before asking again

### BUILD VALIDATION MANDATORY

- Before ANY commit, run: `yarn build && yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn test`
- If ANY command fails, fix errors before proceeding
- This applies to EVERY subtask and main task

## Workflow Execution

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks

- Check for uncommitted changes: `git status --porcelain`
- If uncommitted changes exist, stop and ask user to commit or stash them
- Check for unmerged PRs: `gh pr list --state=open`
- If there are unmerged PRs, warn user and ask if they want to continue
- Sync with main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`

### Phase 2: Task Selection

- Get next task using `tm next` or use provided task ID if specified
- Set task status to in-progress: `tm set-status --id=<task-id> --status=in-progress`

### Phase 3: Branch Strategy

Determine if branch creation is needed:

- Check if task has subtasks using `tm list --parent=<task-id>`
- If task has subtasks (parent task) ‚Üí Create branch `task/<id>-<description>`
- If task has no subtasks (leaf task) ‚Üí Stay on parent branch

### Phase 4: Development Setup

#### For Coding Tasks

1. **Open prd.txt**: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`
2. **Find test specification** for the current task
3. **Get Context7 documentation** for ALL libraries that will be used
4. **Write tests FIRST** based on prd.txt specifications (TDD - Red phase)
5. **Implement code** to make tests pass (TDD - Green phase)
6. **Refactor** if needed while keeping tests green (TDD - Refactor phase)

#### For tasks where only configuration is required

1. Skip TDD requirements
2. Get Context7 documentation for any tools being configured
3. Proceed directly to implementation
4. Still require build validation and approval

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

**For EVERY subtask, follow this sequence:**

### 1. Identify Subtask Type

- [ ] Determine: Coding task (needs tests) vs Config/Setup (no tests)
- [ ] If coding: Locate test spec in prd.txt

### 2. Get Documentation FIRST

- [ ] Identify ALL libraries/tools that will be used
- [ ] Get Context7 docs for each library BEFORE writing any code

### 3. Implementation

- [ ] For coding: Write tests from prd.txt FIRST (TDD - Red phase)
- [ ] For coding: Implement to pass tests (TDD - Green phase)
- [ ] For coding: Refactor if needed (TDD - Refactor phase)
- [ ] For config: Implement directly

### 4. Validation

- [ ] Run: `yarn build && yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn test`
- [ ] Fix ALL errors before proceeding
- [ ] Verify functionality works as expected

### 5. Approval Gate

- [ ] Ask: "Ready for manual testing before commit?"
- [ ] WAIT for explicit user approval
- [ ] If changes requested, implement and return to step 4

### 6. Commit

- [ ] Use intelligent git staging (see commit workflow)
- [ ] Create meaningful commit message
- [ ] Update subtask status to done

### 7. Next Subtask Check

- [ ] Report: "Subtask X.Y complete. Ready for subtask X.Z?"
- [ ] WAIT for user permission
- [ ] Only proceed if approved

## Remember These Critical Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **ONE subtask at a time** - never jump ahead
‚ö†Ô∏è **Context7 docs FIRST** - before writing any code
‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual testing approval** - before EVERY commit
‚ö†Ô∏è **Build validation** - must pass before commit
‚ö†Ô∏è **Test specs from prd.txt** - don't invent test cases
